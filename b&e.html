    <h1>B&E Photography</h1>
    
    <p>B&E photography was a competition brief posted online. I only had a few hours before the deadline so I decided to give it a go and see what I could come up with in limited time. 
    <br><br>
    Although I do not have a copy of the brief anymore, it was pretty open. The only requirements was a beige like colour and also a clean modern design style. With a few images accompanying as a mood-board for branding that they prefered. 
    <br><br>
    This was my entry and although I was selected as one of the preferred candidated, I did not make the final selection. In hind-sight I think there are many improvements that could be made to the logo itself.</p>
