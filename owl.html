    <h1>Owly</h1>
    
    <p>Little owly here was a creation of inspired boredom. I don't mean to upset him but thats just the way it is. Sometimes when I see some artists work I like to try to decypher how an illustrator creates their pieces. This was one of those times. 
    <br><br>
    Although my attempt at the artists work was uncanny, as was expected before hand... I was pleased to experience a new style of work. Trying a limited colour palette and using gradients to create depth was my main goal. I had lots of fun with this piece and was very happy to have a cool little owl by the end of it.
