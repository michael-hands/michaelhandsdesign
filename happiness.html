    <h1>A path to happiness</h1>
    
    <p>This was the digital version of my final major project at University. This is a short book on Buddhist, yoga and meditation - based on the 7 factors of awakening. 
    <br><br>
    I was going through a difficult time myself and the help of such principles gave me some clarity. Western civilisation seems to me to have lost the sense of self and what being truly happy means. I guess this book was an attempt for me to spread my own findings and possibly help others with their own lives.
